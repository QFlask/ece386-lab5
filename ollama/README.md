# Running Ollama Locally

***Student**: Complete below*

## Which model did you choose to run?
We chose gemma3 (1b parameters)

## Paste a haiku from that model. Better be on a fun subject.
Prompt: "Please write me a haiku about making sourdough bread and the care it takes from developing a starter to making more breads."

Flour wakes, yeast takes hold,
Slow rise, patience warms the soul,
Golden crust appears.
